This project features a linear softmax model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using a simple, fully connected layer and optimized with cross-entropy loss. The project also includes an image optimization component, where random noise is iteratively updated to generate visual representations of each digit, demonstrating the modelâ€™s interpretability and class activation patterns.
